my cybersecurity journey
Professional Statement

I am a dedicated healthcare professional with extensive experience across NHS settings, including Adult Intensive Care, diabetic care, and community hospitals. Through my clinical nursing experiences, I’ve gained strong competencies in incident management, safeguarding, documentation accuracy, and maintaining confidentiality—skills that translate seamlessly into cybersecurity.

As part of my transition into digital health and cybersecurity, I am completing structured training on Coursera, where I’m developing hands-on experience with essential security tools such as Wireshark for network traffic analysis, Nmap for vulnerability scanning, Burp Suite for web security testing, and the Linux command line for system navigation and security tasks. I’m also learning key platforms and workflows, including SIEM tools like Splunk, SQL for data querying, Python basics, MITRE ATT&CK, OWASP Top 10, incident response frameworks, and security best practices.

My clinical background has strengthened my ability to stay calm under pressure, analyse complex situations quickly, follow strict protocols, and protect sensitive information—all of which align with the ethos of cybersecurity. I am committed to leveraging my NHS experience, technical training, and growing skill set to support secure, resilient healthcare systems and contribute meaningfully to the cybersecurity field.
